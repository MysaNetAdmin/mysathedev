## Hi there 👋

I am Samy, a french student at @EPITA in the 4th year in the TCOM major !
Currently I'm a laboratory manager, managing a team of assistants & an infrastructure. The laboratory goal is to give a technical side to our theoritical cursus for all students of our major.

I'm currently learning more about networks and network security by myself and trying to obtain Cisco CCNA certification this year !

Feel free to message me or email me !
