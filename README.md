## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Samy, a young french student @EPITA and a developer !
Currently I'm working with @EpiMac as a Swift Teacher and IT Manager, to provide Swift workshops to all IONIS group students & organize discovery days of the engineering professions to young high school students.

I'm currently learning more about the SwiftUI framework and C# by myself and with the courses @EPITA !

Feel free to message me or email me !
